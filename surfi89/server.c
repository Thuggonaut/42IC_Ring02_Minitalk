#1	Static variables are used to ensure consistent behavior and state preservation across different calls to the signal handler, even in situations 
	where signal handling might introduce interruptions and concurrency concerns.
		- Here's a representation of how `bit` changes across multiple calls:

			Call 1: bit = 1
			Call 2: bit = 2
			Call 3: bit = 3
			...
			Call 7: bit = 7
			Call 8: bit = 8 (Process Accumulated Bits)
			Call 9: bit = 0
			Call 10: bit = 1
			...

		- In each call to the `sig_handler` function, the `bit` value retains its state, thanks to it being static.

	For character 'A' (01000001):

	bit = 0:

	(0x01 << 0) results in 00000001.
	Since the bit at position 0 in the binary representation of 'A' is 1, the condition (signal == SIGUSR1) is true.
	The bitwise OR operation i |= (0x01 << bit) combines the value of i with 00000001, setting the first bit of i to 1.
	i becomes 00000001.
	bit = 1:

	(0x01 << 1) results in 00000010.
	Since the bit at position 1 in the binary representation of 'A' is 0, the condition (signal == SIGUSR1) is false.
	The value of i remains unchanged at 00000001.
	bit = 2:

	(0x01 << 2) results in 00000100.
	Since the bit at position 2 in the binary representation of 'A' is 0, the condition (signal == SIGUSR1) is false.
	The value of i remains unchanged at 00000001.
	bit = 3:

	(0x01 << 3) results in 00001000.
	Since the bit at position 3 in the binary representation of 'A' is 0, the condition (signal == SIGUSR1) is false.
	The value of i remains unchanged at 00000001.
	bit = 4:

	(0x01 << 4) results in 00010000.
	Since the bit at position 4 in the binary representation of 'A' is 0, the condition (signal == SIGUSR1) is false.
	The value of i remains unchanged at 00000001.
	bit = 5:

	(0x01 << 5) results in 00100000.
	Since the bit at position 5 in the binary representation of 'A' is 0, the condition (signal == SIGUSR1) is false.
	The value of i remains unchanged at 00000001.
	bit = 6:

	(0x01 << 6) results in 01000000.
	Since the bit at position 6 in the binary representation of 'A' is 1, the condition (signal == SIGUSR1) is true.
	The bitwise OR operation i |= (0x01 << bit) combines the value of i with 01000000, setting the sixth bit of i to 1.
	i becomes 01000001.
	bit = 7:

	(0x01 << 7) results in 10000000.
	Since the bit at position 7 in the binary representation of 'A' is 0, the condition (signal == SIGUSR1) is false.
	The value of i remains unchanged at 01000001.
	After going through the process, the value of i becomes 01000001, which is the correct binary representation of the character 'A'. The condition (signal == SIGUSR1) selectively accumulates bits based on whether the received signal is SIGUSR1.
