/*
#1	Character Encoding:
		- Unicode characters can be encoded using various formats such as UTF-8, UTF-16, and UTF-32. 
			- Each of these encodings uses a different number of bytes to represent characters. 
			- UTF-8, for example, uses 1 to 4 bytes to encode characters. 
		- Using an `int *` allows you to handle these various encodings without worrying about truncating characters or losing 
		  information.
		- Using a `char *`, risks runing into limitations when dealing with characters that require more than one byte.
