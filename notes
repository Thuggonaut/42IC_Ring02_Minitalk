Minitalk:

The purpose of this project is to code a small data change program using UNIX signals.

• Name your executable files client and server.
• You have to turn in a Makefile which will compile your source files. It must not
relink.
• You can definitely use your libft.
• You have to handle errors thoroughly. In no way your program should quit unexpectedly (segmentation fault, bus error, double free, and so forth).
• Your program mustn’t have memory leaks.
• You can have one global variable per program (one for the client and one for
the server), but you will have to justify their use.
• In order to complete the mandatory part, you are allowed to use the following functions:
  ◦ write
  ◦ ft_printf and any equivalent YOU coded ◦ signal
  ◦ sigemptyset
  ◦ sigaddset
  ◦ sigaction
  ◦ kill
  ◦ getpid
  ◦ malloc
  ◦ free
  ◦ pause
  ◦ sleep
  ◦ usleep
  ◦ exit


Mandatory Part:

1. You must create a communication program in the form of a client and a server.
    • The server must be started first. After its launch, it has to print its PID.
    • The client takes two parameters: 
        ◦ The server PID.
        ◦ The string to send.

2. The client must send the string passed as a parameter to the server.

3. Once the string has been received, the server must print it.
    • The server has to display the string pretty quickly. Quickly means that if you think it takes too long, then it is probably too long.
    • Your server should be able to receive strings from several clients in a row without needing to restart.
    • The communication between your client and your server has to be done only using UNIX signals.
    • You can only use these two signals: SIGUSR1 and SIGUSR2.
         1 second for displaying 100 characters is way too much!

Note: 
Linux system does NOT queue signals when you already have pending signals of this type!  Bonus time?


Bonus Part:

• The server acknowledges every message received by sending back a signal to the client.
• Unicode characters support!
